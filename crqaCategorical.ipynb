    "Categorical CRQA (catCRQA) is used to uncover the dynamics of two different behavioural time series, such as conversation transcripts. It is performed in much the same manner as [Categorical RQA](rqaCategorical.ipynb). In a cross recurrence plot (CRP), two integer number time series are plotted against each other on orthogonal axes, ùë•ùëñ = 1...ùëõ and ùë¶ùëó = 1...ùëõ. Recurrent states between the two time series are then indicated by blue points. The resulting plot reflects the way the two systems follow each other's behavioural states in time. CRQA quantifies these properties through various metrics, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recurrence Rate (%REC): The percentage of recurrent points in the plot, which indicates how often states between the two time series reoccur with one another.\n",
    "- Determinism (%DET): The percentage of recurrent points that form diagonal lines of at least a given length (e.g., 2 points), indicating how often the same sequence of states reoccurs in both systems.\n",
    "- Maxline: The length of the longest diagonal sequence of recurrent points. Higher values indicate prolonged periods of recurrent behaviour.\n",
    "- Meanline: The average length of diagonal lines in the plot, giving insight into the typical duration of repeated patterns between the time series.\n",
    "- Entropy (ENT): The Shannon entropy of the distribution of diagonal line lengths, which measures the complexity of coordination between the two systems.\n",
    "- Laminarity (LAM): The percentage of recurrent points forming vertical lines, which reflects instances of stationarity between the time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameters for Running Categorical CRQA\n",
    "\n",
    "Much like [Categorical RQA](rqaCategorical.ipynb), we need to set three parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time delay: This represents the interval between samples required to unfold the temporal structure of a system's trajectory. The appropriate delay helps to reconstruct the system‚Äôs dynamics in the phase space. For categorical CRQA, this is typically set to 1.\n",
    "- Embedding dimension: This is the number of dimensions needed to recover the system's phase space. For categorical CRQA, this is also typically set to 1.\n",
    "- Radius: This defines how close two states must be to be considered recurrent. For categorical CRQA, the radius is set to zero or a very small value, ensuring that only exact matches between categorical states are considered recurrent.\n"

    "If your code ran successfully, you should see the following CRQA metrics for the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- %REC: 7.4% - This value tells us how often the two speakers used similar words at a similar time. Higher recurrence values indicate greater alignment in word usage between the speakers.\n",
    "- %DET: 32.9% - This represents the proportion of recurrence points that form diagonal lines, reflecting the predictability of speaker's word usage.\n",
    "- Maxline: 14 - This metric identifies the longest sequence of recurring word usage between speakers.\n",
    "- Meanline: 2.5 - This is the average length of diagonal lines in the recurrence plot, giving us insight into the typical duration for which the speakers' word usage remained the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's see how these metrics compare when we analyse conversation data of individuals who were not paired together. Click \"play\" on the code chunk below to run CRQA on a [transcript](data/crqaCategorical/conversation_pseudo.txt), comprised of pseudo data, and observe the differences."
