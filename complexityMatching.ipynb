    "In other sections of this tutorial, like [DFA](dfaAnalysis.ipynb) and [Windowed DFA](dfaWindowed.ipynb), we learnt how to run DFA. Notably, fractal scaling in human behavior tends to match that of an interacting system. This phenomenon, termed complexity matching, can index the convergence of behaviour at a global (i.e., non-local) level. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several approaches to computing complexity matching:\n",
    "- Correlating ùõº across the sample: Traditionally, a correlation between the overall ùõº values within a sample is used to calculate complexity matching. \n",
    "- Difference in ùõº values: Some work has quantified complexity matching as the absolute difference between two ùõº values, providing an intuitive index of matching.\n",
    "- Cross correlation using windowed DFA ùõº values: More recently, researchers have employed cross-correlation analysis using ùõº values from [Windowed DFA](dfaWindowed.ipynb).\n",
    "- Detrended cross correlation anaylsis (DCCA): This is a bivariate generalisation of DFA that is designed to detect power-law cross-correlations, in turn quantifying complexity matching. \n",
