    "Continuous CRQA (contCRQA) is used to uncover the dynamics of two different behavioural time series, such as physiological signals (e.g., heart rate or EEG data) or motion tracking data from interacting individuals. It is performed in much the same manner as [Continuous RQA](rqaContinuous.ipynb). In a cross recurrence plot (CRP), the two time series are plotted against each other on orthogonal axes, ùë•ùëñ = 1,2,...,ùëõ and ùë¶ùëó = 1,2,...,ùëõ. Recurrent states between the two time series are then indicated by blue points. The resulting plot reflects the way the two systems follow each other's behavioural states in time. CRQA quantifies these properties through various metrics, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recurrence Rate (%REC): The percentage of recurrent points in the plot, which indicates how often states between the two time series reoccur with one another.\n",
    "- Determinism (%DET): The percentage of recurrent points that form diagonal lines of at least a given length (e.g., 2 points), indicating how often the same sequence of states reoccurs in both systems.\n",
    "- Maxline: The length of the longest diagonal sequence of recurrent points. Higher values indicate prolonged periods of recurrent behaviour.\n",
    "- Meanline: The average length of diagonal lines in the plot, giving insight into the typical duration of repeated patterns between the time series.\n",
    "- Entropy (ENT): The Shannon entropy of the distribution of diagonal line lengths, which measures the complexity of coordination between the two systems.\n",
    "- Laminarity (LAM): The percentage of recurrent points forming vertical lines, which reflects instances of stationarity between the time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameters for Running Continuous CRQA\n",
    "\n",
    "Much like [Continuous RQA](rqaContinuous.ipynb), running CRQA on continuous data, requires us to select three parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time delay: This represents the interval between samples required to unfold the temporal structure of a system's trajectory. The appropriate delay helps to reconstruct the system‚Äôs dynamics in the phase space. For continuous CRQA, time delay is typically calculated using an [average mutual information (AMI) analysis](ami.ipynb).\n",
    "- Embedding dimension: This is the number of dimensions needed to recover the system's phase space. For continuous CRQA, embedding dimension is typically calculated using a [false nearest neighbors (FNN) analysis](fnn.ipynb).\n",
    "- Radius: This defines how close two states must be to be considered recurrent. Unlike categorical RQA, the radius for continuous data is a threshold based on a distance metric (e.g., Euclidean distance), ensuring that nearby‚Äîbut not necessarily identical‚Äîstates are considered recurrent.\n"

    "#### Selecting the Optimal Radius\n",

    "When selecting a radius, best practice involves using a range of values and choosing the one that yields a reasonable set of %REC values for biological systems (typically between 0.5% and 5%). In this case, the best radii for our walking data appears to be 0.3, which yields a %REC value 3.57%. \n",
