    "Continuous RQA (contRQA) is used to examine the dynamics of continuous behaviour sequences, such as physiological signals (e.g., heart rate or EEG data) or tracking data from a motion capture system. Recurrence analysis allows us to visualise the dynamics of such behaviours by plotting 'recurrent' states on a 2D recurrence plot. Here, the data points are mapped to orthogonal axes, ùë•ùëñ = 1,2,...,ùëõ and ùë¶ùëó = 1,2,...,ùëõ, representing a 2-dimensional plot. The states ùë•ùëñ and ùë¶ùëó that reoccur are plotted, indicated by blue points on the recurrence plot. From the recurrence plot, we can determine the degree of recurrence, the persistence of repeating sequences, and other patterns that give us insight into the underlying dynamics of the system. RQA quantifies these properties through various metrics, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recurrence Rate (%REC): The percentage of recurrent points in the plot, which indicates how often states reoccur.\n",
    "- Determinism (%DET): The percentage of recurrent points that form diagonal lines of at least a given length (e.g., 2 points), indicating patterns that repeat in the same order.\n",
    "- Maxline: The length of the longest diagonal sequence of recurrent points.\n",
    "- Meanline: The average length of diagonal lines in the plot, giving insight into typical repeating sequences.\n",
    "- Entropy (ENT): The Shannon entropy of the distribution of diagonal line lengths, which measures the complexity of recurrent patterns.\n",
    "- Laminarity (LAM): The percentage of recurrent points forming vertical lines, which can reflect how states are trapped for extended periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notably, for auto-recurrence metrics, the main diagonal (i.e., the line of identity) is excluded from RQA metrics, as it simply reflects a point being recurrent with itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameters for Running Continuous RQA\n",
    "\n",
    "To run RQA for continuous data, we need to select three parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time delay: This represents the interval between samples required to unfold the temporal structure of a system's trajectory. The appropriate delay helps to reconstruct the system‚Äôs dynamics in the phase space. For continuous RQA, time delay is typically calculated using an [average mutual information (AMI) analysis](ami.ipynb).\n",
    "- Embedding dimension: This is the number of dimensions needed to recover the system's phase space. For continuous RQA, embedding dimension is typically calculated using a [false nearest neighbors (FNN) analysis](fnn.ipynb).\n",
    "- Radius: This defines how close two states must be to be considered recurrent. Unlike categorical RQA, the radius for continuous data is a threshold based on a distance metric (e.g., Euclidean distance), ensuring that nearby, but not necessarily identical, states are considered recurrent."
