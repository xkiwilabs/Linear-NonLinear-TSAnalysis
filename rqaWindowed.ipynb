    "In other sections of this tutorial, like [Categorical RQA](rqaCategorical.ipynb) and [Continuous RQA](rqaContinuous.ipynb), you can learn how to run RQA on categorical and continuous time series data. In this section, we'll focus on performing a windowed version of RQA. This allows you to assess changes in recurrence over the course of a time series. By breaking the time series down into smaller overlapping segments (or 'windows') you can capture changes in the system's behaviour that a full time-series analysis might miss.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Selecting the Window Size and Overlap\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform windowed RQA, we need to select the following:\n",
    "- Window size: This specifies the number of samples you wish to include in each window. \n",
    "- Overlap: This is the degree of overlap between windows, often expressed as a percentage (e.g., 50% overlap). \n",
    "\n",
    "Window size selection for RQA should consider the specific dynamics being studied, the length of the time series, and the sample rate. For example, if you have 5 minutes of gaze data sampled at 50 Hz (i.e., 50 samples per second), and you want to assess RQA metrics for 30-second intervals, you would select a window size of 1500 samples.

As such, you can compare those results to understand how a windowed analysis differs from non-windowed RQA.\n",

    "For our windowed RQA, we need to select an appropriate window size. The acceleration data was sampled at 50 Hz (i.e., 50 times per second), and the time series is 10 minutes long, resulting in a total of 30,000 samples. Let's set a window size of 1 minute, which corresponds to 3000 samples. We'll also set the overlap between consecutive windows to 50%, meaning that each window overlaps the next by 30s. \n",
