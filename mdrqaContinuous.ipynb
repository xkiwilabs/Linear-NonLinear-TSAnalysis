    "Multidimensional Recurrence Quantification Analysis (MdRQA) is used to uncover the dynamics of multivariate behavioural time series data. This can be useful where multiple signals are collected from one or two individuals (e.g., movement and physiology), or where we wish to collect data from groups of individuals. It is performed in much the same manner as [Continuous RQA](rqaContinuous.ipynb). However, instead of performing phase space reconstruction (see [AMI](ami.ipynb) and [FNN](fnn.ipynb)), each measured variable from the multivariate time series dataset can be used as a different phase space dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "As in other RQA techniques, various metrics are returned including:\n",
    "- Recurrence Rate (%REC): The percentage of recurrent points in the plot, which indicates how often states between the time series reoccur with one another.\n",
    "- Determinism (%DET): The percentage of recurrent points that form diagonal lines of at least a given length (e.g., 2 points), indicating how often the same sequence of states reoccurs across time series.\n",
    "- Maxline: The length of the longest diagonal sequence of recurrent points. Higher values indicate prolonged periods of recurrent behaviour.\n",
    "- Meanline: The average length of diagonal lines in the plot, giving insight into the typical duration of repeated patterns between the time series.\n",
    "- Entropy (ENT): The Shannon entropy of the distribution of diagonal line lengths, which measures the complexity of coordination between the time series.\n",
    "- Laminarity (LAM): The percentage of recurrent points forming vertical lines, which reflects instances of stationarity between the time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameters for Running MdRQA\n",
    "\n",
    "Much like [Categorical](crqaCategorical.ipynb) and [Continuous](crqaContinuous.ipynb) CRQA, running MdRQA requires us to select three parameters. As noted above, however, time delay and embedding dimension can be set using the multivariate time series data as dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time delay: This represents the interval between samples required to unfold the temporal structure of a system's trajectory. The appropriate delay helps to reconstruct the system’s dynamics in the phase space. \n",
    "- Embedding dimension: This is the number of dimensions needed to recover the system's phase space.\n",
    "- Radius: This defines how close two states must be to be considered recurrent. For continuous data, the radius is a threshold based on a distance metric (e.g., Euclidean distance), ensuring that nearby—but not necessarily identical—states are considered recurrent.\n"

    "- %REC: .2% - This value tells us how often the participants' positional data returns to similar states at the same time. Higher recurrence values indicate more coordination between the participants.\n",
    "- %DET: 99.1% - This represents the proportion of recurrence points that form diagonal lines, reflecting the predictability of the participants' coordinated movement patterns.\n",
    "- Maxline: 8489 - This metric identifies the longest sequence of recurring acceleration patterns between the four participants. A higher value here suggests that they exhibited more stable patterns of coordinated activity.\n",
    "- Meanline: 11.9 - This is the average length of diagonal lines in the recurrence plot, giving us insight into the typical duration for which the participants' movements remained similar.\n",
    "\n",

Although the windowed tutorial doesn't contain MdRQA, the code can be updated for those who wish to challenge themselves!"
