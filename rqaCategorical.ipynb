    "Categorical RQA (catRQA) is used to examine the dynamics of discrete behaviour sequences, such as song lyrics (lyricsA.txt) or eye movements between different locations (eyemovs_1.txt). Recurrence analysis allows us to visualise the dynamics of a behaviour, by plotting 'recurrent' states on a 2D recurrence plot. Here, an integer number sequence is mapped to the orthogonal axis ùë•ùëñ = 1...ùëõ and ùë¶ùëó = 1...ùëõ, of the 2-dimensional plot, and the states ùë•ùëñ and ùë¶ùëó that reoccur are plotted (represented by blue points in the recurrence plot). From the plot, one can determine the degree of repetition, the length of repetitive sequences, and other important patterns in the data. RQA provides measures to quantify these properties, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recurrence Rate (%REC): The percentage of recurrent points in the plot, which indicates how often states reoccur.\n",
    "- Determinism (%DET): The percentage of recurrent points that form diagonal lines of at least a given length (e.g., 2 points), indicating patterns that repeat in the same order.\n",
    "- Maxline: The length of the longest diagonal sequence of recurrent points.\n",
    "- Meanline: The average length of diagonal lines in the plot, giving insight into typical repeating sequences.\n",
    "- Entropy (ENT): The Shannon entropy of the distribution of diagonal line lengths, which measures the complexity of recurrent patterns.\n",
    "- Laminarity (LAM): The percentage of recurrent points forming vertical lines, which can reflect how states are trapped for extended periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameters for Running Categorical RQA\n",
    "\n",
    "To run categorical RQA, we need to select three parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time delay - This represents the interval between samples required to unfold the temporal structure of a system's trajectory. The appropriate delay helps to reconstruct the system‚Äôs dynamics in the phase space. In categorical RQA, this is typically set to 1.\n",
    "- Embedding dimension - This is the number of dimensions needed to recover the system's phase space. For categorical data, this is typically set to 1.\n",
    "- Radius - This defines how close two states must be to be considered recurrent. In catRQA, the radius is set to zero or a very small value, ensuring that only exact matches between categorical states are considered recurrent."

    "- %REC: 6.8% - This value tells us how often the words in the lyrics repeat, highlighting the overall recurrence in the song.\n",
    "- %DET: 22.2% - This represents the proportion of recurrence points that form diagonal lines, indicating predictable patterns in word usage.\n",
    "- Maxline: 15 - This metric identifies the longest sequence of repetitive word usage, helping us understand the longest repeating phrases in the song.\n",
    "- Meanline: 2.6 - This is the average length of those repeating patterns, giving us insight into how long typical repeated phrases are.\n",
